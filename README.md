[Download the latest version (v0.0.2)](https://github.com/ArthurVerrez/webpage-string-extractor-browser-extension/releases/download/v0.0.2/webpage-string-extractor-v002.zip).

1. **Unzip** the downloaded file to a folder on your computer.
2. **Open Chrome** and go to `chrome://extensions/`.

4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder you just unzipped.

Notes:

- The first time you load the extension, you might need to refresh the page you want to extract data from if it was opened before installing the extension.
- If you move the extension folder, you will need to reload it in Chrome, so keep it in a stable location.
- The above process is for Chrome. Other Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Brave, etc.) have similar steps.
